 *   one variable, and every variable must have at least one level.  This precondition is checked
 *   by the function, which will throw an error if the condition is not met.
 * @param data: A collection of paired observations of the variables in the distribution.  Any
 *   observation for a variable in the network must be for one of the levels of that variable.
 *   This precondition is checked by the function, which will throw an error if the condition is
 *   not met.   Observations for variables that do not occur in the network are ignored.
 * @param learningRate:  This optional argument controls the initial step
 *   size that the line search method will use.  Conceptually, it represents the weighting that is
 *   applied to the prior and data average values when computing a new estimate for the cpt values.
 *   When this value is 1, then both are weighted equally.
 * @param maxIterations: This optional argument controls the maximum
 *   number of steps that the algorithm is allowed to take before giving up.  Changing
 *   this value may be necessary when the provided data set is very small or very sparse.
 * @param tolerance: This optional argument specifies the target tolerance which
 *   must be satisfied in order for the algorithm to terminate.
 *
 * @returns An object containing the status of the optimization.  The "converged" field of this
 *   object can be checked by the calling function to tell if the algorithm reached the optimal
 *   assignment within the given tolerance and number of iterations.
 *
 * NOTE: Although convergence is guaranteed, the resulting assignments may not be globally
 *   optimal.   It may be necessary to use additional heuristics (e.g. tabu search) to
 *   find globally optimal assignments.
