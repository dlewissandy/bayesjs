 * @param current - The tower of derivatives at the current set of
 *   parameters
 * @param stepSize - The magnitude of the step to take along the ascent
 *   direction away from the current set of parameters
 * @param objectiveFn - The objective function being maximized.
 * NOTE: This function assumes that the Hessian matrix is well conditioned
 * and negative definite at the current set of parameters.  This
 * precondition is not checked, and must be satisfied by the caller.
